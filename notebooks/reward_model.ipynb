The riddle will involve adding consecutive integers, finding the square of a number, and then squaring the sum of odd numbers up to an unknown value.\\n\\nTo start, take a number between [1,9], increment it by 1 using an operator '+', and print the result. Then, create a constant value 9, and add the consecutive integers from [1,9] using another operator '.', then square the  result and print. To solve the third step, take a constant variable value, then square the sum of all odd numbers between 0 and this constant.
